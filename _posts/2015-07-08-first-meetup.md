Hey. We're starting a monthly meet-up to learn about maps. This Maptime thing is just what it sounds like: a time for maps. ALL THINGS MAPS.

Yes. That covers a lot. We'll focus on open and free tools for making maps, putting them on the web, principles of cartography & data visualization, and where
& how to get public geodata. This is also a space where you can nerd out about geotechnology, design, typography, historical geography, aerial mapping,
citizen cartography, hand-drawn maps, mental maps, geocoding, etc, etc.

Some people are experts, and some people are just getting started, but all of us are learning, so why not do it together?

If you like maps and want to learn how to make them drop me a line. If you know something, if you know nothing, if you want to share... Join us.

Feel free to email [maptimenola@gmail.com](mailto:maptimenola@gmail.com) and check [maptime.io/nola](http://maptime.io/nola) for updates once I learn how to update a webpage. :) (see, you don't have to know an ounce
of tech to start)
