title: Hello NOLA

Maptime is just what it sounds like: a time for maps. ALL THINGS MAPS. Some people are experts and some people are just getting started, but all of us are
learning so why not do it together? We'll focus on open and free tools for making maps, putting them on the web, principles of cartography & data
visualization, and where & how to get public geodata.

You can bring your own projects to work on, provide tutorials for others, or just hang out and socialize or ask questions. Sometimes we do field trips!
